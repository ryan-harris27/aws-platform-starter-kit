# RFC Process

1. Create a new RFC file in this folder using the next available number (e.g. `rfc-001-*.md`).
2. Write the problem, goals, non-goals, proposed solution, and rollout plan.
3. Keep it short: 1–2 pages max.
4. RFCs are merged via PR after review and become the source of truth for decisions.
5. Once merged, implementation work should reference the RFC number in commits and PRs.
