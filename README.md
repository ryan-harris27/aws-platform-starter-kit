## What this is

`aws-platform-starter-kit` is a platform-infrastructure starter repository for building a secure, repeatable AWS foundation using AWS CDK (TypeScript). It is designed to model how an internal platform team would manage multi-tenant AWS environments by providing reusable infra patterns, guardrails, and automation through CI/CD. The goal is to create a clean baseline that can be extended into a real landing zone with budgets, security controls, account provisioning, and standardized constructs for internal consumers.

## Goals

Create a production-grade starter kit for platform infrastructure in AWS.

## Non-goals

This is not an application template.
This is not intended to replace AWS Control Tower.
